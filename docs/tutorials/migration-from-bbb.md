# Migration from BigBlueButton

It is simple to switch from BigBlueButton to PlugNmeet. You will not need to modify any of the code in your existing solution. This means that your current BBB-compatible solution/plugin will also work with plugNmeet. You will only need to alter API information from your API/plugin configuration, like this:

```bash
URL: https://YOUR-PLUGNMEET-HOST/API-KEY/bigbluebutton/
Secret: API-SECRET
```

For example with demo server:

```bash
URL: https://demo.plugnmeet.com/plugnmeet/bigbluebutton/
Secret: zumyyYWqv7KR2kUqvYdq4z4sXg7XTBD2ljT6
```

That's it!
