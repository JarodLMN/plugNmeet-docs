plugNmeet is built on a unique architecture with top-level security, providing an end-to-end encrypted video and audio experience. 

It encrypts all data sent from the server to the browser using a TLS certificate. WebRTC libraries use Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for real-time protocol packets (RTP) transmission over user datagram protocol (UDP), and media packets are encrypted with Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP).
