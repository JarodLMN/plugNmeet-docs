## 1. Entering the room

When we enter the room, two options will appear: "**Microphone**" and "**Listen only**". If we press on "**Microphone**", it means that we want to actively participate by audio in the meeting.

Whereas, if we select "**Listen only**", you can only hear what the other participants say, but you will not be able to participate by audio.

1. **Microphone**

   - After having selected the "Microphone" option, it will tell you through a box to select the microphone you want to use. It is here, where you can select the source of your microphone, either the microphone of the device you use or the headphones you have connected.
   - Finally, you click "Join" and you will be able to talk in the meeting.

2. **Listen only**

   If you click on the "listen only" option, immediately afterwards it will direct you to the meeting so that you can only listen to the interventions of the other participants.

   Important: The option you choose at the start of the meeting, either "Microphone" or "listen only", does not mean that it will be final for the entire meeting. Since, then you can change the settings again during the meeting.
