## Update Client Version 

By default, the client load will choose the **remote** option. In this option, the client version will update automatically with the plugin update. Normally users donÂ´t need to do anything with this. 

If you want to use some customized version of the client, you need to choose the **local** option, in this way you can manually update the client version.
